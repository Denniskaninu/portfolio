- Dynamic Project Loading: Load project data from a separate `projects.js` file to populate the projects section with title, description, tech stack, and links.
- Interactive 3D Project Cards: Display projects as interactive 3D flip cards or cubes with hover animations (glow, tilt, depth effects) for an engaging user experience.
- AI Skill Highlighter: Use an AI tool to maintain an updated list of the most in-demand skills (Next.js, React, Node.js, Python, Django, TailwindCSS, Docker, Cloud, AI/ML, Flutter, Mobile Dev, Databases like PostgreSQL & MongoDB) to feature in the about me section, sourced from leading tech job sites in Kenya.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric Indigo (#6F00FF) to convey innovation and modernity. Its futuristic and energetic tone aligns with the cutting-edge design the user is aiming for.
- Background color: Dark slate gray (#2F4F4F), a desaturated variant of the primary color at approximately 25% saturation, fitting the dark color scheme. Its deep tone allows the Electric Indigo to pop, creating visual contrast while maintaining harmony.
- Accent color: Violet (#8F00FF), an analogous hue shifted approximately 30 degrees to the 'left' of Electric Indigo on the color wheel. A brighter color, will guide the viewers eye.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines. Body text: 'Inter' (sans-serif)
- Use minimalistic, glowing icons to represent skills, technologies, and social media links.
- Implement a card-based layout with 3D depth effects for the About Me and Projects sections.
- Use smooth, immersive section transitions powered by Framer Motion, with optional Three.js integration for rotating 3D background elements.
